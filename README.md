# FoodTracker
First Swift project

Using the online course Developing in Swift - Jump Right In to learn how to develop an app using XCode.

Site is https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/

So far I have created a basic GUI with a couple buttons, an image view, a text field and a label.
The text field can edit the label text. Both buttons also change the label text to predefined messages, but each button was created a different way. The image view can be pressed on and changed by accessing the simulated phone's camera roll to select a picture to view.

Again, this is only a beginner's app being created off a tutorial. I'll get better as I go along.

UPDATE 18/05/2017

A number of functions have now been created, which allow the user to give input into the app and have an output given.
This includes changing the text field, choosing an image to display and changing the rating shown on the stars. This is all very cool...

I'll continue on with this tutorial, but I wish to finish it as soon as possible!
