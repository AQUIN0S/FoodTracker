# FoodTracker
First Swift project

Using the online course Developing in Swift - Jump Right In to learn how to develop an app using XCode.

Site is https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/

So far I have created a basic GUI with a couple buttons, an image view, a text field and a label.
The text field can edit the label text. Both buttons also change the label text to predefined messages, but each button was created a different way. The image view can be pressed on and changed by accessing the simulated phone's camera roll to select a picture to view.

Again, this is only a beginner's app being created off a tutorial. I'll get better as I go along.
